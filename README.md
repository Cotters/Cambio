## About

I wanted to try making a card game so I decided to code this fun little game I learnt while travelling South America.
There is a Rules page in the app detailing how to play, but basically it's a matching game where you need to remember what cards you have.

*Build using SwiftUI.* (Not built using TDD, but would make a great kata!)

Plenty of refactoring to do as I threw this together v quickly.
